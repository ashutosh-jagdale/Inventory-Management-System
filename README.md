# Inventory-Management-System
A Database Management System to maintain a track of record of various components accurately and optimally. 

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><b>PURPOSE</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">To successfully maintain a track of record of various electronic and mechanical components, it is essential to manage your inventory stock as accurately and optimally as possible. One way to do this is by using and understanding the right inventory management reports. Accurate, up-to-date and relevant inventory management report will allow you to discover trends, identify weaknesses and strengths, and fill gaps and inefficiencies. Using these insights, you can take steps to grow profitably while eliminating wasted time and resources. Due to the reasons, an acute requirement for this Management System was discovered.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5"><b>PRODUCT SCOPE</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="9">Inventory management has to do with keeping accurate records of goods that are ready for use. This often means having enough stock of goods to the inventory totals as well as subtracting the most recent use of finished components to students Item management se addition, deletion, insertion, updating and printing etc can be done. The system allows referencing of data from different tables in a database. The implementation of this project will make the Robocon Team data management easier. It will reduce paperwork as well as manual errors during data handling. It will allow the users to effectively administer the consistent track of its components. Furthermore, it will allow systematic inventory of the data of components.<br>
•   The designer will use this SRS as a basis for creating the system’s design. The designer will continually refer back to this SRS to ensure that the system they are designing will fulfil their needs.<br>
•   The developer will use this SRS as a basis for developing the system’s functionality. The developer will link the requirements defined in this SRS to the software they create to ensure that they have created software that will fulfil all of the student’s documented requirements.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><b>FRAMEWORK</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="18">The general flow of data is as follows: Data will be added through a Computer Software to a database created in SQL. Other activities retrieve and use this data as per requirement of data.<br>
•   The requirement analysis was performed.<br>
•   Taking into consideration the flaws of existing methodologies we discussed and listed down the requirements.<br>
•   Entity Relationship model for the min project was developed.<br>
•   Forms were made.<br>
•   Testing was conducted using certain test data taken from the client.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20"><b>EXISTING METHODOLGIES</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">The system which is used nowadays has some drawbacks which need to be improved for better performance. As the technology is developed day by day, we need to use this technology so we can get an efficient result in adequate time. In Robocon team, all students had to access the components in electronic and mechanical part, which is a time-consuming task and was impossible to track inventory manually and sometimes problems of lack of inventory balance.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24"><b>PROPOSED METHODOLOGIES</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Physically maintaining the record takes lot of time and is not a efficient way, so we created an application using JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP framework which uses MySQL as Backend to efficiently save and retrieve data whenever required. This data then can be analysed and used to keep track of both electronic and mechanical components which save lot of time. It keeps warehouse organised.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28"><b>INTENDED AUDIENCE AND READING SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">We are developing our project Inventory Management System for Robocon team but this project can be deployed in any labs of colleges. The intended audience(users) are the team members of Robocon. Logins will be provided to the students of the team to handle the system. Reading the general descriptions before proceeding to the specific requirements would help the readers easily understand the background behind the functions of the system. The students will use this SRS to verify that the developer team has created a product that is acceptable to them.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32"><b>HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="36">•   This project needs to be executed on Operating System like Windows and Linux. The preferred being 1080 X1920.<br>
•   It requires a minimum 1 MB storge space with further storage requirement as volume of data increases.<br>
•   The project has been tested for windows and Linux OS.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38"><b>SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="43">•   The development of this project requires an IDE for JAVA framework.<br>
•   The IDE can be NETBEANS which is the IDE for JAVA, it can also be an Eclipse IDE with appropriate plug in and package installed.<br>
•   This project can be run and tested on Android Virtual devices or emulator based in Android Studio.<br>
•   The database is an RDBMS named SQLite which should be available on the device where this project is executed.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45"><b>ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47">While creating this software, we assumed that only two primary users would be accessing the database, them being:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">Admin</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="50">Student</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">Students who are basically the team members can use the components or categories whenever they require it. Admin is the member who have special access i.e., they can add, delete, update the components as well as categories from the inventory. Also, it is assumed that there can be more than 1 admin.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55">Inventory management has to do with keeping accurate records of goods that are ready for use. This often means having enough stock of goods to the inventory totals as well as subtracting the most recent use of finished components to students. The database management system uses MYSQL at the backend to store data. The GUI developed in JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS, PHP and BOOTSRAP can be used on any OS. Item management i.e., addition, deletion, insertion, updating and printing etc can be done. The system allows referencing of data from different tables in a database. The implementation of this project will make the Robocon Team data management easier. It will reduce paperwork as well as manual errors during data handling.</p>
